# Challenge

For a given  N find the smallest M so that all n power of 2    have different results in 2**i mod M

Example for N = 4 ,

Try m= 3

Power power%3  power%4  power%5

2          2                 2                2

4          1                 0                4

8          2                 0                3 

16         1                 0                1

M is 5 because in the last col we have different results

For N = 8 M is 11.
